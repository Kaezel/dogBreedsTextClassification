# Text2Breed — Streamlit Starter

A minimal two‑page feel (landing → finder) as shown in your mockups.
- Loads an embedding model once (`all-mpnet-base-v2`).
- Classifies with cosine similarity against a small corpus you can replace.
- Shows Top‑1 + Top‑3 with images.

## Quickstart

```bash
# inside a clean venv
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run
streamlit run app.py
```
